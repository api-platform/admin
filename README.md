# API Platform Admin

API Platform Admin is a tool to automatically create a fancy (Material Design) and fully-featured administration interface
for any API supporting [the Hydra Core Vocabulary](http://www.hydra-cg.com/), including but not limited to all APIs created
using [the API Platform framework](https://api-platform.com).

The generated administration is a 100% standalone Single-Page-Application with no coupling to the server part, according
to the API-first paradigm.

API Platform Admin parses the Hydra documentation then uses the awesome [Admin On Rest](https://marmelab.com/admin-on-rest/)
library (and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)) to expose a nice, responsive, management interface (Create-Retrieve-Update-Delete)
for all available resources.

You can also customize all screens by using Admin On Rest components and even raw JavaScript/React code.

## Features

* Automatically generate an admin interface for all the resources of the API thanks to hypermedia features of Hydra
* Generate list, create, show, edit screens as well as a delete button
* Generate suitable inputs and fields according to the API doc (e.g. number HTML input for numbers, checkbox for booleans, selectbox for relationships...)
* Generate suitable inputs and fields according to Schema.org types if available (e.g. email field for http://schema.org/email)
* Handle relationships
* Pagination support
* Automatically validate if a field is mandatory client-side according to the API description
* Send proper HTTP requests to the API and decode them using Hydra and JSON-LD formats
* Nicely display server-side errors (e.g. advanced validation)
* **100% customizable**

## Getting Started

Install the skeleton and the library:

Start by installing [the Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/) ([NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) is also supported) and
the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) tool.

Then, create a new React application for your admin:

    $ create-react-app my-admin

Now, add install `api-platform-admin` library in your newly created project:

    $ yarn add api-platform-admin

Finally, edit the `src/App.js` file like the following:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import HydraAdmin from 'api-platform-admin';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return <HydraAdmin entrypoint="https://demo.api-platform.com"/> // Replace with your own API entrypoint
  }
}

export default App;
```

Your new administration interface is ready! Type `yarn start` to try it!

Note: if you don't want to hardcode the API URL, you can [use an environment variable](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-custom-environment-variables).

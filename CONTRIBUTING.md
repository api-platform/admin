## Pull Requests

### Writing a Pull Request

Please base your changes on the `main` branch.

### Two ways to write your patch

You can patch `@api-platform/admin` by two different ways:
- by linking `@api-platform/admin` sources to an existing project;
- by installing this project and running it through Storybook.

#### Linking the Source Version to an existing project

If you already have a project in progress, you can develop directly from it.

The instructions below explain how to install the source version of API Platform Admin in your project and contribute a patch.

Your client should already use `@api-platform/admin` and its bootstrap file (usually: `src/App.tsx`) should at least contains: 

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { HydraAdmin } from '@api-platform/admin';

function App() {
  return (
    <HydraAdmin entrypoint="https://demo.api-platform.com" />
  )
}

export default App
```

Install your own version of `@api-platform/admin`:

```console
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/api-platform/admin.git
```

Link it:

```console
cd admin
yarn link
cd ../<yourproject>
yarn link "@api-platform/admin"
```

Use the React version of your project to build `@api-platform/admin`:

```console
cd node_modules/react/
yarn link
cd ../../../admin
yarn link react
```

Build continuously your `@api-platform/admin` version:

```console
yarn install --force
yarn watch
```

Open a new terminal console with the same path.

Start your client:

```console
cd ../<yourproject>/
yarn install --force
yarn dev --force
```

> You can now hack in the cloned repository of `api-platform-admin`.

#### Running Admin through Storybook

If you don't have an existing API Platform application, or don't want to use `yarn link`, you can use one of the bundled example APIs, and visualize the admin through [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

Install everything:

```shell
docker compose up
```

Go to http://localhost, accept the self-signed certificate, and see the running Admin.

To stop and prune the simple API Platform backend:

### Testing Your Changes

Before sending a Pull Request, make sure the tests pass correctly:

```console
yarn test
```

### Matching Coding Standards

The API Platform Admin project follows coding standards inspired by the [Airbnb JavaScript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
But don't worry, you can fix CS issues automatically using the [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) tool:

```shell
yarn fix
```

And then, add the fixed files to your commit before pushing.
Be sure to add only **your modified files**. If any other file is fixed by CS tools, just revert it before committing.

### Sending a Pull Request

When you send a PR, just make sure that:

* You add valid test cases (Jest).
* Tests are green.
* You make a PR on the related documentation in the [api-platform/docs](https://github.com/api-platform/docs) repository.
* You make the PR on the same branch you based your changes on. If you see commits
that you did not make in your PR, you're doing it wrong.
* Also don't forget to add a comment when you update a PR with a ping to [the maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/api-platform/people), so he/she will get a notification.
* Squash your commits into one commit (see the next chapter).

All Pull Requests must include [this header](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

## Squash your Commits

If you have 3 commits, start with:

```shell
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

An editor will be opened with your 3 commits, all prefixed by `pick`.

Replace all `pick` prefixes by `fixup` (or `f`) **except the first commit** of the list.

Save and quit the editor.

After that, all your commits will be squashed into the first one and the commit message will be the first one.

If you would like to rename your commit message, type:

```shell
git commit --amend
```

Now force push to update your PR:

```shell
git push --force-with-lease
```

# Tag a New Version (Contributors Only)

Always execute the tests before releasing a new version:

```shell
yarn build
yarn test
yarn lint
```

To fix linting errors, you can use `yarn fix`.

To release a new version:

```shell
yarn version # this creates a tag and a commit
git push
git push --tags
```

Travis will then publish the version on npm.

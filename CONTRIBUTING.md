## Pull requests

### Writing a Pull Request

First of all, you must decide on what branch your changes will be based. If the changes your are going to make are
fully backward-compatible, you should base your changes on the latest stable branch.
Otherwise, you should base your changes on the `master` branch.

### Installing the source version

To install the source version of API Platform Admin in your project and contribute a patch, run the following command:

    # Create your `CLIENT` that will use `api-platform-admin` (replace <yourproject> by your project's name) :
    $ yarn create react-app <yourproject>
    $ cd <yourproject>
    $ yarn add @api-platform/admin

    # Replace src/App.js by this one
    ```
    import React from 'react';
    import { HydraAdmin } from '@api-platform/admin';

    export default () => <HydraAdmin entrypoint="https://demo.api-platform.com"/>; // Replace with your own API entrypoint
    ```

    # Install your own version of `@api-platform/admin`
    $ cd ..
    $ git clone https://github.com/api-platform/admin.git

    # Link it
    $ cd admin
    $ yarn link
    $ cd ../<yourproject>
    $ yarn link "@api-platform/admin"

    # Use the React version of your project to build `@api-platform/admin`
    $ cd node_modules/react/
    $ yarn link
    $ cd ../../../admin
    $ yarn link react

    # Start your `api-platform-admin` version
    $ yarn install
    $ yarn watch

    (open a new terminal console with the same path)

    # Start your `CLIENT`
    $ cd ../<yourproject>/
    $ yarn start

You can now hack in the cloned repository of `api-platform-admin`.

### Testing your changes

Before sending a Pull Request, make sure the tests pass correctly:

```bash
yarn test
```

### Matching coding standards

The API Platform Admin project is inspired by the [Airbnb JavaScript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
But don't worry, you can fix CS issues automatically using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) tool:

```bash
yarn fix
```

And then, add fixed file to your commit before push.
Be sure to add only **your modified files**. If another files are fixed by cs tools, just revert it before commit.

### Sending a Pull Request

When you send a PR, just make sure that:

* You add valid test cases (Behat and PHPUnit).
* Tests are green.
* You make a PR on the related documentation in the [api-platform/docs](https://github.com/api-platform/docs) repository.
* You make the PR on the same branch you based your changes on. If you see commits
that you did not make in your PR, you're doing it wrong.
* Also don't forget to add a comment when you update a PR with a ping to [the maintainer](https://github.com/orgs/api-platform/people), so he/she will get a notification.
* Squash your commits into one commit. (see the next chapter)

All Pull Requests must include the following header:

```markdown
| Q             | A
| ------------- | ---
| Bug fix?      | yes/no
| New feature?  | yes/no
| BC breaks?    | no
| Deprecations? | no
| Tests pass?   | yes
| Fixed tickets | #1234, #5678
| License       | MIT
| Doc PR        | api-platform/doc#1234
```

## Squash your commits

If you have 3 commits. So start with:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

An editor will be opened with your 3 commits, all prefixed by `pick`.

Replace all `pick` prefixes by `fixup` (or `f`) **except the first commit** of the list.

Save and quit the editor.

After that, all your commits where squashed into the first one and the commit message of the first commit.

If you would like to rename your commit message type:

```bash
git commit --amend
```

Now force push to update your PR:

```bash
git push --force
```

# Tag a new version (contributors only)

Always test before releasing a new one:

```
yarn build
yarn test
yarn lint
```

To fix linting errors, you can use `yarn fix`.

To release a new version:

```bash
yarn version # this creates a tag
git push
git push --tags
```

Travis will then publish the version on npm.

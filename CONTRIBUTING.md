To have your code integrated in the API Platform project, there are some rules to follow, but don't panic, it's easy!

## Reporting Bugs

If you happen to find a bug, we kindly request you to report it. However, before submitting it, please:

* Check the [project documentation available online](https://api-platform.com/docs/)

Then, if it appears that it's a real bug, you may report it using GitHub by following these 3 points:

* Check if the bug is not already reported!
* A clear title to resume the issue
* A description of the workflow needed to reproduce the bug

> _NOTE:_ Don't hesitate giving as much information as you can (OS, browser, ...)

## Pull Requests

### Writing a Pull Request

Please base your changes on the `main` branch.

### Two ways to write your patch

You can patch `@api-platform/admin` by two different ways:
- if you already have a project in progress: read [Linking the Source Version to an Existing Project](#linking-the-source-version-to-an-existing-project);
- if you do not have an existing project: read [Running Admin Through Storybook](#running-admin-through-storybook).

#### Linking the Source Version to an Existing Project

If you already have a project in progress, you can develop directly from it.

The instructions below explain how to install the source version of API Platform Admin in your project and contribute a patch.

Your client should already use `@api-platform/admin` and its bootstrap file (usually: `src/App.tsx`) should at least contains:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { HydraAdmin } from '@api-platform/admin';

function App() {
  return (
    <HydraAdmin entrypoint="https://demo.api-platform.com" />
  )
}

export default App
```

Install your own version of `@api-platform/admin`:

```console
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/api-platform/admin.git
```

Link it:

```console
cd admin
yarn link
cd ../<yourproject>
yarn link "@api-platform/admin"
```

Use the React version of your project to build `@api-platform/admin`:

```console
cd node_modules/react/
yarn link
cd ../../../admin
yarn link react
```

Build continuously your `@api-platform/admin` version:

```console
yarn install --force
yarn watch
```

Open a new terminal console with the same path.

Start your client:

```console
cd ../<yourproject>/
yarn install --force
yarn dev --force
```

> You can now hack in the cloned repository of `api-platform-admin`.

#### Running Admin Through Storybook

If you do not have an existing project, you can use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to visualize changes in the source code, and test them.

This development stack consists of two Docker containers:
- `pwa`: containing the `<Admin>` sources and Storybook;
- `php`: holding the API sources.

Additionally, this method allows testing the integration between API Platform and the `admin` component by writing stories, scenarios and tests.

Install everything:

```shell
docker compose up
```

Before accessing the Storybook instance, make sure to go to https://localhost to accept the self-signed certificate. Once it's done, you'll see the API documentation running on a customized version of Swagger UI.

Now you can go to http://localhost:3000/ to see the Storybook instance in action. The changes you'll make in the source code will be hot-reloaded.

> Tips: you can run Storybook directly in your local machine by running `yarn storybook`. It will take another port, usually 3001. Make sure to have the API running before.

To run a command directly inside a container, run:
```shell
# Run a command in the php container
docker compose exec -T php your-command

# Run a command in the pwa container
docker compose exec -T pwa your-command
```

### Testing Your Changes

Before sending a Pull Request, make sure the tests pass correctly:

```shell
# Functional tests
yarn test
# End to end tests
yarn test-storybook --url http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

If you add a new feature, don't forget to add tests for it.
- Functionnal tests are written with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/);
- End-to-end tests are written with [Storybook play functions](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/play-function/).

### Matching Coding Standards

The API Platform Admin project follows coding standards inspired by the [Airbnb JavaScript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
But don't worry, you can fix CS issues automatically using the [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) tool:

```shell
yarn fix
```

And then, add the fixed files to your commit before pushing.
Be sure to add only **your modified files**. If any other file is fixed by CS tools, just revert it before committing.

### Sending a Pull Request

When you send a PR, just make sure that:

* You add valid test cases (Jest).
* Tests are green.
* You make a PR on the related documentation in the [api-platform/docs](https://github.com/api-platform/docs) repository.
* You make the PR on the same branch you based your changes on. If you see commits
that you did not make in your PR, you're doing it wrong.
* Also don't forget to add a comment when you update a PR with a ping to [the maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/api-platform/people), so he/she will get a notification.
* Squash your commits into one commit (see the next chapter).

All Pull Requests must include [this header](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

## Squash your Commits

If you have 3 commits, start with:

```shell
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

An editor will be opened with your 3 commits, all prefixed by `pick`.

Replace all `pick` prefixes by `fixup` (or `f`) **except the first commit** of the list.

Save and quit the editor.

After that, all your commits will be squashed into the first one and the commit message will be the first one.

If you would like to rename your commit message, type:

```shell
git commit --amend
```

Now force push to update your PR:

```shell
git push --force-with-lease
```

# Tag a New Version (Contributors Only)

Always execute the tests before releasing a new version:

```shell
yarn build
yarn test
yarn lint
```

To fix linting errors, you can use `yarn fix`.

To release a new version:

```shell
yarn version # this creates a tag and a commit
git push
git push --tags
```

Travis will then publish the version on npm.
